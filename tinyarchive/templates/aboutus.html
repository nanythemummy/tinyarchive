<header><h1>General Description of Digital Archive Project-Bear Project</h1></header>
<p>In this project, we plan to build a digital archive for five bear sculptures on UC Berkeley campus. Having bear as the school mascot, 
    we can see a lot of bear related elements around the campus, including bear sculptures. They are an important part of our campus scenery 
    and history, but there is a lack of accessible digital collection of these campus bear sculptures online. Therefore, we decide to build 
    a digital archive for these bears, including their names, measurements (length, weight, height), color, material, installed time, location, 
    designer, and sculptor as metadata. We also plan to include a map that marks out their locations, and hope to let tourists find them more easily.</p>
<p>We decide to put the sculpture California Golden Bear on our exhibit page, mainly because this is the most famous bear sculpture on campus. For each sculpture, 
    we will add their background story as an introduction that allows the user of this archive to better know them.  In order to store these sculptures in a logical way, 
    we will demonstrate them in the order based on their installed year, from the oldest to the newest. </p>

<h3>Members’ Role</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Beike</strong> :I will mainly be doing the data schema part. I will try to collect the data for bears and integrate them into different tables based on the information style. Then I will make connections between these tables and outline the logic of this bear database.</li>
    <li><strong>Peiying and Kanglin</strong> :We mainly worked together to put the data of our 5 objects in an accessible web page. It includes processing our data via Django and Github. We are also responsible for any work related to coding, debugging, and testing. We hope to design an interactive and fun site that presents the bear sculptures to any interested groups. </li>
    <li><strong>Leah</strong> :I will be responsible for working with the specific information for each bear sculpture in the digital archive such as the descriptions of its background story, color, size and other specifics pertaining to the sculpture. Furthermore, I will also be working with creating other texts in the archive such as the introductions of objects, conclusions etc.</li></ul>
