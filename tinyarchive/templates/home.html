    <p>This archive houses five items found at Treasure Island Beach in Laguna Beach, California. This project is dedicated to preserving the essence of this breathtaking location through a unique lens - the items left behind by the myriad of individuals and sea life who have on its shores. Join us on this journey as we catalog and digitize five "found" items, each telling a compelling story about the life and activities that transpire on this sunny Southern California coastline.</p>
    <p>In this exhibition, we delve into the beauty of everyday life's overlooked and hidden treasures. From delicate and rare plants to curious creatures and artifacts inadvertently left behind by beach-goers, these seemingly ordinary objects offer profound insights into Treasure Island's vibrant life in Laguna Beach. We invite you to explore a fusion of visual storytelling and 3D modeling through a blend of photography and photogrammetry techniques.</p>
    <p>Beyond merely documenting these items, our exhibition celebrates the natural world and the preservation of life on the coast. As you navigate through the virtual gallery, you will uncover the essence of Treasure Island, a wide array of insightful stories about life along the California coastline and the life that visits it. This digital archive is an ode to the beauty of preservation. It is an invitation to discover, enjoy, and appreciate the beauty that surrounds us, even in the most unassuming places. We invite you to witness the beauty and important lessons of "found" items, unlocking a treasure trove of memories and natural life.</p>
